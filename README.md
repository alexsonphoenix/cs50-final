# cs50-final
This was CS50!
I am Nguyễn Hoàng Sơn from Vietnam, I took CS50 2019!

With the final project, I have decided to build a flask app website with the main focus is helping farmers keep track of their farming.

This web app is most suited to small and medium farming scale. It can be used as a desktop app or mobile app thanks to the responsiveness.
Farmer will be registering for an account to use the app.


The website consists of 4 main functionalities:
1. News: Stay up to date with latest farming practice and technology

2. Daily Notes: Record daily farm activities

3. Calculators: Help with plan and budget on the farm

4. Your Farm: Statistics view of the farm which gives farmers insights on what's going on


The potential to scale up:
- This web app allows farmers to input daily activity data on the farm. Therefore, the data is time-based and it is just the matter of representing the data to help making better decisions


Specifications:
- Materials used: Flask, Python, Jinja2, Bootstrap, WTForms, Sqlite, Javascript, Jquery, CSS, HTML.
- 1. News page: Connect with other reliable sources of farming technique and technology
- 2. Daily Notes: Forms for inputing and linked to a route to insert into the database, query the database to show history of inputs
- 3. Calculators: Javascrips, Jquery, no database ralated
- 4. Your Farm: Query from the database to display
